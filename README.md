# Roadmap For Data Science/AI
![vienn](https://www.corpnce.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DS_MLRelationship.jpg)

- **AI** : "Enables Machines To Think" 
- **ML** : "ML is a subset of AI that uses statistical learning algorithms to build smart systems. The ML systems can automatically learn and improve without explicitly being programmed."
- **DL** : (**Multi Layer Neural Network**) This subset of AI is a technique that is inspired by the way a human brain filters information. It is associated with learning from examples. DL systems help a computer model to filter the input data through layers to predict and classify information. Deep Learning processes information in the same manner as the human brain.
- **Data science** refers to the process of extracting clean information to formulate actionable insights using AI/ML/DL.

# Fundamentals:
- Python ( Pycharm / jupyter-Notebook / Google-Colab )
- Mathematics(Check sub-folder)
- Statistics(Check sub-folder)

# Data Collection:
- Already Available/ API
- Web Scrapping (Beautiful Soup / Scrapy / Urlib)
- Generating Data from Scratch

# Data Analysis:
- Numpy/Pandas
- Feature Engineering
- Data Wrangling
- Exploratory Data Analysis

# Data Visualisation:
- Matplotlib / Seaborn / GGplot
- Tableau
- PowerBI

# Machine Learning:
- **Supervised Learning**: This algorithm consist of a target / outcome variable (or dependent variable) which is to be predicted from a given set of predictors (independent variables). Using these set of variables, we generate a function that map inputs to desired outputs. The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: This algorithm, we do not have any target or outcome variable to predict / estimate. It is used for **clustering** population in different groups, which is widely used for segmenting customers in different groups for specific intervention.
- **Reinforcement Learning** : Using this algorithm, the machine is trained to make specific decisions. It works this way: the machine is exposed to an environment where it trains itself continually using trial and error.
